# ProjectMakeMoreMoney

This is the statistical analysis I performed on the data collected form my job as a server at Eno Vino Downtown.

Initially, I analyzed the data from the first summer prior to returning for the second summer in hopes to increase my earning potential. Recently, I analyzed the complete data set to determine if the analysis helped me make more money.
